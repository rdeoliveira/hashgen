      "But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.",
      "Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.",
      "In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?",
      "A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.",
      "Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.",
      "And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.",
      "the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?",
      "2,867 Americans have now died in this war.",
      "Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.",
      "These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?",
      "When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.",
      "300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.",
      "The addition of 4,000 American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.",
      "And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on American soldiers.",
      "“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”",
      "And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve.",
      "The American people have been extraordinarily resolved.",
      "It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.",
      "The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.",
      "Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put American troops in danger.",
      "As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.",
      "But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.",
      "and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.",
      "According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should \"mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”",
      "Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.",
      "My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.",
      "It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.",
      "It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.",
      "For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.",
      "Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement.",
      "It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.",
      "These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.",
      "These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.",
      "And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused.",
      "Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.",
      "Americans know this.",
      "That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.",
      "Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans.",
      "The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.",
      "And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.",
      "If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.",
      "Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans.",
      "Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership.",
      "Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.",
      "Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.",
      "It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.",
      "We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.",
      "Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less.",
      "We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.",
      "Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!",
      "This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.",
      "And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners.\"",
      "These are the Americans that I know.",
      "Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans.",
      "How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?",
      "We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.",
      "It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.",
      "It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.",
      "Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.",
      "I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.",
      "And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.",
      "Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.",
      "The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.",
      "Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.",
      "Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.",
      "Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.",
      "And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.",
      "Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess."

      "Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.",
      "Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.",
      "Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.",

      "As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.",
      "You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.",
      "I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.",
      "And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.",
      "Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.",
      "I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.",
      "Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.",
      "When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.",
      "Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.",

      "Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.",
      "What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.",
      "It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.",

      "Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.",
      "This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.",
      "The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.",
      "By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.",

      "Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.",
      "For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.",
      "And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.",
      "You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.",

      "And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.",
      "Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.",

      "We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.",
      "In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.",
